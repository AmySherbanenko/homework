# Case Study 

## ZenGo (1)
-----------
Imagine yourself getting home with a big haul from the grocery store. Hands full, you left the car door open. you're trying to open the front door to get those heavy groceries inside, but theres one thing stopping you... the door is locked. ZenGo is something that makes those small details that we don't enjoy one bit, easier to get around.
   
(3)Zengo is app available on IOS and Android. (2)It is a keyless crypto wallet, making it very simple to use, but yet most secure. Totally recoverable wallet to invest in cryptocurrency. Y'know those eggs you dropped trying to get your keys? They wouldn't have fallen if your door had a secure keyless access. "[ ZenGo's ] Keyless Wallet technology, based on Computation (MPC) replaces traditional single point of failure security with distributed secret shares and facial biometric", Zengo said in an article for Cision PR Newswire. 
   
(4)This keyless wallet company is being lead by the founders Ouriel Ohayon, Omer Shlomovits, and Tal Be'ery. Ouriel is directly responsible for marketing adn product. Omer is  a crypotologist that takes care of the cryptography. Last but not least, Tal is in charge of security and engineering. (6)They all came together in 2018 to look for investors. 
   
(7)Benson Oak Ventures was a leading contributor to the company. They initially invested into ZenGo. This brought on more than ten investors including Samsung, Insight Partners, Elron, BlockNation, and FJ Labs. All of these companies combined raised four million dollars. Whereas now they are trying to create their own credit card. In April of 2021, they receieved twenty million dollars of funding for their idea.
   
(11)ZenGo lies in the cryptocurrencies domain. (13)Others companies in this domain include WeBull, Coinbase, Binance, Kucoin, and Kraken. (8)Now although they don't seem to be having any financial issues, they do have quite a few competitors. Some of their biggest competitors right now include Spartera, NuID, and Icon Foundation. ()All of these competitors are private financial services. Comparing all of these comapnies, ZenGo is thriving much more than any of the other companies. 
   
Other than financial problems, ZenGo does still run into problems. A big issue they have is that they miss best practices in SSL/TLS configuration. Another big one that they are looking out for is the fact that there could be a disruption of their service, which is called DOS. Lastly, they have previously known vulnerable libraries without a working proof of concept. Proof of concept is evidence that demonstrates a design, concept, or business proposal. This was a big part of turning there feasible idea into a reality. A reality that looking down the line looks a little interesting.
  
(12)We can all assume that nobody expected to be buying cryptocurrency from our phones back in the early 2000s. Now that we are in 2021 and the market is thriving learning about cryptocurrencies so far, what can we expect for the years ahead? Well, so far we can assume the future will have cryptocurrency in it, without a doubt. CNBC asked experts in a variety of fields to take a gander on what crypto will look like in the next few years. Ivory Johnson, a Certified Financial Planner and Found of Delancey Wealth Management said, "Cryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations". This being said from multiple people, in a backround that can be backed by years of experience in the field, its safe to say we have a future in cryptocurrency. 
  
(9)A future in cryptocurrency is diversity, usability made for everyone, within the range of being 18 or older. ZenGo can be downloaded and used in 188 countries, including the US, EU, and the UK. They are working on added other locations. There are no hidden fees or addiotnal costs. Making it easy for anyone to use. It is easy accessability for any age. (15) An unfair advantage they do have it the fact that they've recieved so much funding. Companies in the same phase in their business plan have recieved more than 50% less funding. That's quite an unfair advantage.

(10)ZenGo has high security standards for the transactions within their app. They use their very own Keyless Wallet technology. They've replaced traditional private keys with two independently created mathematical secret shares. One share is stored on your mobile device, whereas the other is stored on the ZenGo server. They reassure there is no point of failure. Say someone hacked the ZenGo servers - which would be very, very unlikely - they could get that share (password), but they still wouldn't be able to access your account. Because they do not have your code that is fully stored on your device your using. (14) They also guarantee ZenGo does not have access to your funds. A bank takes the money in your bank account to buy stocks and lend out loans for themselves, ZenGo cannot do that. They cannot take your money, or have access to your account. "To send funds, you initiate a process in which the server and device shares communicate to sign the transaction without ever revealing their secrets to each other", ZenGo says on their website. It is safe to say that ZenGo is taking the crypto application market by storm.

(16) In the graphs that Craft has displayed, their website traffic went from 300,000th to 250,000th in a single month. That is considerably good for only being in the cryptocurrency scene for a few years. Compared to their competitors, they are right in the middle for Employee growth percentage. Craft is a website that overviews companies and see how their doing in the market. Craft has given them an A (92/100) for their cybersecurity rating. Which is impressively decent.
